# BreadBin Emulation Runtime / Nearly Documented

For the BreadBin to be able to execute useful code, it can run BER/ND, which is an instruction-level
emulation of the 65C816 CPU. Execution speed is of course pretty slow compared to a real 65C816, 
but you would not expect top-performance from a bread with such short arms and legs. 
But as long as it gets the job done eventually, this is totally fine by me.
